Bhavisha and Dhruv were thrilled;  they had  just activated their new  device, ‘Itihāsa’, a time machine  to travel to the past! Taking a clue  from their history lesson, they  decided to visit Pāṭaliputra for  their first journey — they knew it  was about the same location as

modern-day Patna.

Landing on the outskirts of the great city, a little dizzy, they saw a  girl talking to a person on horseback dressed in strange clothes.  As he left, she turned to them, and they asked her for her name.

“My name is Ira, daughter of Kanhadas, the ironsmith. Welcome  to Pāṭaliputra!”

“Glad to meet you, Ira. Our names are Bhavisha and Dhruv.”

“Sshh! Keep your voices down! Do you see those soldiers marching  past? They’re heading to battle against a neighbouring kingdom  that has been troubling us. Our king avoids war when he can, but  he also protects his people when needed. My father helped forge  many of the swords they carry, and my uncle is one of the soldiers  in the group. I just came to see him off… I don’t know when he’ll  return.”

“This bridge keeps us safe,”  explained  Ira.  “It’s  lifted  whenever there is a danger of attack on the city. And no, it’s not  a river, it’s a moat; once the drawbridge is lifted, it makes it more  difficult to approach the fortifications. Can you see those hills and  forests in the distance? They provide us with timber, herbs, and  many other valuable resources. Elephants for the army are also  captured from the forest and trained for the army.”

Fig. 5.3

“What is the opening in that hill?” asked Dhruv.

“It’s a cave. Our king is getting it carved out for a community of  monks. I hope we can visit it when it’s finished!”

86

(The group watches as an  impressive procession of soldiers  crosses a sturdy drawbridge  leading out of the city, some on  horseback and the army chiefs  on elephant back. Then, the  three children cross the same  drawbridge to enter the city.)

“What kind of bridge is this?”  asked Bhavisha. “And is it a  river below?”

(As  they  move  through  Pāṭaliputra,  they  take  in  its  splendour — towering wooden ramparts with watch towers,  majestic palaces and buildings, lively streets. Ira gestures towards  a bustling market filled with traders from distant lands.)

“You must visit our main market before you leave! Our king  welcomes travellers from all over, so you’ll get silk from China,  spices and gems from the south, fine clothes from different  regions—there’s nothing you won’t find in Pāṭaliputra!”

“What are those people over there doing?” asked Dhruv.

“Oh, these are street acrobats; they build human pyramids, sing  and dance, or act in short plays to entertain people. Sometimes,  they perform in front of the king!”

“Your king sounds very powerful,” remarked Bhavisha. “Does he  rule the region around Pāṭaliputra?”

“Much more than that!” answered Ira. “He rules over a vast land,  far, far beyond this city. His authority extends over many villages,  towns and kingdoms. My uncle told me that it takes close to two  months on horseback to reach the borders of the territory!”

“That sounds bigger than just a kingdom… What do you call it?”

“It is called an Empire,” Ira stated with evident pride.

What is an Empire?

The word ‘empire’ comes from the Latin ‘imperium’, which  means ‘supreme power’. Simply put, an empire is a collection  of smaller kingdoms or territories over which a powerful ruler  or group of rulers exert power, often after waging war against  the smaller kingdoms. The smaller territories still had their own  rulers, but they were all tributaries to the emperor, who ruled  the whole territory from a capital, usually a major centre of  economic and administrative power.

In ancient Sanskrit texts, words commonly used for ‘emperor’  made this clear; they included samrāj, meaning ‘the lord of all’  or ‘supreme ruler’; adhirāja or ‘overlord’; and rājādhirāja or  ‘king of kings’.

Tributary: A tributary,  in our case,  is a ruler  or a state  that has  submitted to  an emperor  and pays  tribute— that is,  money, gold  (or other  precious  metals),  grain,  livestock,  elephants  or other  valuable  goods  produced  in their  kingdom and  is given to  the emperor  as a sign of  submission,  loyalty or  respect. A  synonym for  ‘tributary’ is  ‘vassal’, and  another way  to express  this is to  say that the  tributary  or vassal  kingdoms  accepted the  emperor’s  overlordship.

Indian history is full of empires. They rose, expanded, lasted  for a while, declined, and disappeared. In fact, the last empire  that ruled the Subcontinent existed less than a century ago! But  now is not the time to tell that story; we start at the other end  of time, so we may understand how empires functioned in the  distant past and how they deeply impacted India’s evolution at  all levels — political, economic, social, and cultural.

Æ Empires extended over vast areas and had diverse people  with differing languages, customs and cultures. How  do you think the emperors made sure that they lived in  harmony? Discuss in groups and share your thoughts with  the class.

Æ Looking at the many challenges involved in managing  an empire, why should a king be so keen to expand his  kingdom into an empire and become an emperor? Here  are a few possible answers; see if you can think of a few  more:

 An ambition to ‘rule the entire world’, a metaphor  for controlling large territories and ensuring that  they would be remembered for posterity;

 A wish to bring large areas under control and gain  access to their resources to build economic and  military strength;

 A desire for great wealth for himself and for the  empire.

In return for tribute and loyalty, emperors generally allowed  regional kings or chiefs to continue to govern their areas.

LET’S EXPLORE

Warfare apart, what other methods do you think the rulers  might have used to expand their empires? Pen your ideas and  share them with your class.

Trade , trade routes and guilds

Conducting military campaigns, especially in distant lands, is  not as simple as it might seem. Maintaining an army is a costly  affair: soldiers need to be fed, clothed, equipped with weapons,  and paid; elephants and horses need to be cared for; roads or  ships have to be built, and so on. All this requires considerable  economic power, control over the workforce, and access  to resources.

We can now understand that economic activity — especially  production and trade — is one of the keys to maintaining an  empire and ensuring people’s welfare and quality of life, which  a good ruler should be concerned with. Therefore, establishing  and controlling trade routes all over the empire’s territory  and beyond is of great importance. That way, the goods traded  will grow in quantity and variety, and more trade means more  income for the producers and increased tax collections for  the ruler.

Returning to the case of ancient India, what would have been the  traded goods? There is plenty of evidence on this, at least, both  from the literature and archaeological excavations — textiles,  spices, agricultural produce, luxury items such as gems and  handicraft products, and various animals were among the main  items of trade. All this brisk trade was not limited to India; many  Indian goods travelled towards distant countries by land or sea.

More often than not, traders were not just isolated individuals  carrying out their own business. They soon understood  the benefits of joining forces and creating guilds (śhrenīs).  Guilds were powerful associations of traders, craftsmen,  moneylenders or agriculturists. As far as evidence shows,  a guild had a head (who was usually elected) and executive

officers who were supposed to have all kinds of ethical qualities.  Two things made traders’ guilds a remarkable institution. First,  they brought together people who ended up being collaborators

rather than competitors, as they realised that sharing resources  and information on markets, supply and demand, workforce,  etc., was to everyone’s benefit. Second, as an ancient text put  it, “Cultivators, traders, herdsmen, moneylenders, and artisans  have authority to lay down rules for their respective classes”;  in other words, guilds had the autonomy to create their own  internal rules, and the king was not to interfere with them (and  why should he, if trade flourished?).

Guilds spread over large parts of India and endured for centuries.  Even after they ceased to exist formally, their spirit continued  to influence India’s trade and business activities, sometimes  even to this day. The institution of guilds provides an excellent  example of the self-organising abilities of Indian society. The  ancient village unit, with its various committees and councils,  provides another. Indeed, an enlightened ruler would let people  organise themselves and refrain from interfering if the local  institutions worked satisfactorily.

The Rise of Magadha

The period between the 6th and the 4th century BCE was  one of profound change in north India. We briefly visited the  sixteen mahājanapadas earlier — those large kingdoms of north  and central India with their assembly system. One of them,  Magadha (modern-day south Bihar and some adjoining areas),  rose in importance and set the stage for the fusion of many  kingdoms into India’s first empire. Powerful early kings, such as  Ajātaśhatru, played a crucial role in establishing Magadha as a  dominant centre of power.

Two  of  the  most  famed  religious  figures  of  the  world — Siddhārtha Gautama, who became known as the  Buddha, and Vardhamānan, better known as Mahāvīra — lived  in the time of King Ajātaśhatru. Revisit their teachings in the  Grade 6 textbook’s ‘India’s Cultural Roots’ chapter.

Magadha was located in the resource-rich Ganga plains, with  fertile land, abundant forests for timber, and elephants. Also,  remember how the use of iron transformed other technologies,  such as agriculture and warfare. Iron ore and other minerals  from the nearby hilly regions proved crucial for the expansion  of the kingdom. The use of iron ploughs to till the land increased  agricultural produce, and lighter and sharper iron weapons  strengthened the capabilities of the army.

LET’S EXPLORE

Æ Take a close look at the panel given above.  How many  types of weapons can you identify? What different uses  of iron can you make out?

Æ In the left part of the panel, a parasol (chhattra) is kept  over the casket containing the Buddha’s relics. Why do  you think this was done?

The  production  of  surplus  food  grains  allowed  more  people to focus on the arts  and crafts, which were in  demand inside and outside the  empire’s borders. The Ganga  and Son rivers provided a  geographical  advantage  for  trade, as they could be used for  transportation. The flourishing  trade boosted the empire’s  income and contributed to Magadha’s rise.

Around the 5th century BCE, Mahāpadma Nanda rose to  prominence in Magadha and founded the Nanda dynasty. He  successfully unified many smaller kingdoms and extended  his empire across parts of eastern and northern India. As the  economy thrived, he began issuing coins, demonstrating his  economic power. We also learn from Greek accounts that the  Nanda dynasty maintained a large army.

From various accounts of the Nanda dynasty, it appears that its  last emperor, Dhana Nanda, though very rich, became highly  unpopular as he oppressed and exploited his people. This paved  the way for the Nanda empire to be conquered and absorbed  into what would become one of the largest empires India ever  knew — the Maurya empire.

The famed Sanskrit grammarian  Pāṇini lived around the 5th  century BCE, during the time  of the Nandas. He is known for  composing the Aṣhṭādhyāyi, an  ancient text that lists the rules of  Sanskrit grammar in 3,996 short  sūtras.

The Arrival of the Greeks

While events unfolded in Magadha, located in the eastern part  of the subcontinent, what was happening in the northwestern  region? This area was home to smaller kingdoms along an  ancient route connecting to the Mediterranean. Among them,  according to Greek accounts, were the Pauravas, led by their  king, Porus.

BCE:

Alexander, a young and powerful Greek  king from Macedonia, campaigned  against the Persian Empire to avenge  earlier Persian invasions of Greece  (during which some Indian soldiers  from the Persian-ruled northwest of  India fought against Greeks!). Alexander  conquered the Persian Empire; the  influence of Greek culture spread. His  empire now spread over three continents,  one of the largest in world history.

Fig. 5.10

DON’T MISS OUT

The satraps were governors of provinces of Persian and  Greek empires who were left behind by the overlord (like  Alexander) to manage the far-off territories. These satraps  had significant power and freedom despite being mere  officials of the rulers. Can you guess how it was possible for  them to exercise such power?

THINK ABOUT IT

Why do you think Alexander wanted to rule over the entire  world? What would he have gained from it?

LET’S EXPLORE

When, after the battle, Alexander asked Porus how he wished  to be treated, Porus answered, “Like a King.” Alexander then  left Porus at the head of his kingdom, as satrap. With the help  of your teachers, find more details on the battle between Porus  and Alexander. Enact a play of this battle scene using your  imagination in addition to what you have discovered.

Back in Persia, Alexander faced rebellions and

political turmoil. After he fell ill and died in  Babylon at the age of 32, his immense empire  was soon divided between his generals and the

satraps, who created their own kingdoms.

327–325

BCE

Eager to reach the “end of the world”, Alexander pushed on  further east and brought his campaign to India, defeated Porus in  Punjab and, encountering fierce resistance from local tribes and  rulers, massacred the population of several cities. Greek records  mention that in a few battles, “women fought side by side with  their men.” Alexander himself was seriously wounded in a battle.  Tired and homesick, his soldiers lost the will to fight and refused  to move deeper into India, towards the Ganga River. Alexander  and part of his army retreated to Persia, but through the coastal  route in the south and Iran’s harsh desert regions, resulting in  heavy losses to his troops out of thirst, hunger and disease.

Alexander’s dialogue with the Gymnosophists

Alexander heard of a group of Indian sages whom the Greeks  called ‘Gymnosophists’ or ‘naked philosophers’ (probably  because they wore very little clothing), who were renowned for  their wisdom. Alexander challenged them with tricky questions  in the form of riddles, warning that he would put those who  gave wrong answers to death. However, the Gymnosophists  responded to his questions calmly and intelligently. Alexander  was impressed and, in the end, spared them all. Over the  centuries, different versions of this story have been told, making  it one of the most fascinating encounters in history!

The Mighty Mauryas

After that brief sojourn to the northwest, let us return to

Magadha, where we witnessed the decline of the Nanda  empire. Around 321 BCE, just a few years after Alexander  left India with his army, a new dynasty and new empire

emerged: the Maurya Empire founded by Chandragupta

Maurya. It quickly absorbed the Nanda empire’s territories  and went on expanding beyond.

As per many accounts, Chandragupta managed this feat with the  help of an able mentor named Kauṭilya, who used his knowledge  of politics, governance and economics to create an empire that  remains one of the greatest in Indian history.

98

According to one account, Alexander  asked, “Which is stronger, life or  death?” One of the sages replied, “Life,  because it endures while death does  not.” Alexander then asked, “How can  a man be most loved?” “If he is most  powerful and yet does not inspire  fear,” came the reply, perhaps as a  hint to the mighty ruler!

Historians view such exchanges as  a meeting of two great traditions —  Greek and Indian philosophies.

The story of Kauṭilya

According to Buddhist texts, Kauṭilya—sometimes referred to as  Chāṇakya or Viṣhnugupta—was a teacher at the world-renowned  Takṣhaśhila (modern-day Taxila) university. His legendary tale  begins in the court of Dhana Nanda, who as we saw, had become  highly unpopular.

overthrew the Nandas and took control of Magadha to establish  his rule, with Pāṭaliputra as his capital. Do you remember that  Magadha had many advantages because of its geography, an  established economic system and a flourishing trade? These,  combined with the advice of the master strategist, Kauṭilya,  helped Chandragupta Maurya gradually expand his empire.  He defeated the Greek satraps left behind by Alexander in  the northwest and integrated the region into an empire that  stretched from the northern plains to the Deccan plateau.

After Chandragupta Maurya defeated the Greeks, he maintained  a diplomatic relationship with them and hosted in his court a  Greek historian and diplomat, Megasthenes, who wrote about  his travels in India in his book Indika — the first such written  account — unfortunately lost except for some excerpts quoted  by later Greek scholars.

Kauṭilya’s concept of a kingdom

Kauṭilya had a clear vision of how a kingdom (rājya) should  be established, managed and consolidated. In his famous  work Arthaśhāstra (literally, ‘the science of governance and  economics’), he listed directives in many areas like defence,

economics, administration, justice, urban planning, agriculture  and people’s welfare. One of his most important political concepts  is the saptānga (see fig 5.15) or the seven parts that constitute  a kingdom.

According to Kauṭilya, the saptānga together must create  a settled, well-protected, and prosperous kingdom to be  maintained both through warfare and through alliances for  peace, as the case may be. He emphasised the importance  of law and order in society, which necessitated a strong  administration. He also detailed many laws to deal with  corruption and specified punishments for any activities that  went against the wellbeing of the people.

THINK ABOUT IT

 Kauṭilya says, “A king shall increase his power by  promoting the welfare of his people, for power comes  from the countryside which is the source of all economic  activity. [The king] shall show special favours to those in  the countryside who do things which benefit the people,  such as building embankments or road bridges, beautifying  villages, or helping to protect them.”

 Why do you think it was important to take special care of  the countryside? (Hint: Think back to what you have learnt  at the beginning of this chapter)

Kauṭilya’s central philosophy of governance is in tune with  Indian values: “In the happiness of his subjects lies the king’s  happiness; in their welfare his welfare. He shall not consider  as good only that which pleases him but treat as beneficial  to him whatever pleases his subjects.” In other words,  however powerful a king may be, he must give first place to the  people’s interests.

The King Who Chose Peace

At the beginning of his  reign, Aśhoka was quite  ambitious. He had inherited  a vast empire but further  expanded it to cover almost  the entirety of the Indian  subcontinent,  except  for  the southernmost region,  but including present-day  Bangladesh  and  Pakistan  and parts of present-day Afghanistan. One encounter, however,  is said to have changed the path of his life. According to one of  his edicts he once marched on Kalinga (modern-day Odisha),  where he waged a ferocious war. Seeing the enormous amount  of death and destruction on the battlefield, Aśhoka chose to  give up violence and, to the greatest extent possible, adopt the  path of peace and non-violence that the Buddha taught.

104

Another king of the Maurya  dynasty was Aśhoka (268– 232 BCE),  Chandragupta’s  grandson,  who  came  to  be  credited  with  major  administrative and religious  achievements.

Historians have sometimes called Aśhoka  a ‘great communicator’ since he issued in  many parts of his empire edicts engraved on  rocks or pillars that contained his messages  for the people and encouraged them to  follow dharma. Most of these edicts were  inscribed in Prakrit, which was the popular  language in many parts of India and written  in the Brahmi script (Brahmi is the mother  of all regional scripts of India).

We have referred to the  Prakrit language written in  Brahmi script. What does  this mean? Very simply, a  language is what we speak,  while script is what we write  a language in. Can you think  of examples of this in our  everyday life?

In his edicts, Aśhoka called himself ‘Devanampiya Piyadasi’;  the first word means ‘Beloved of the Gods’; the second, ‘one  who regards others with kindness’. And indeed, the language  of the edicts makes it clear that he was interested in depicting  himself as a benevolent and compassionate ruler. Let us see a  few examples of this.

Although some southern kingdoms were not part of the Mauryan  kingdom, Aśhoka supported their overall wellbeing. He claimed  to provide medical care for people and animals even beyond his

empire, prohibited hunting and cruelty to animals, and ordered  medical treatment for them when necessary. If so, Aśhoka  was an early contributor to nature conservation and wildlife  preservation. He said he had established rest houses and wells  at regular intervals along the main roads of his empire and got  fruit and shade trees planted. He also claimed to encourage all  sects (the different schools of thought present in his time) to  accept each other’s best teachings and study them.

Although we need not take all of Aśhoka’s claims literally, it is  clear that in line with Kauṭilya’s philosophy of governance, he  paid attention to the welfare of his subjects and made efforts to  reach out to them.

You read about the word ‘dharma’ (dhamma in Prakrit) in  Grade 6. Its essence cannot be easily captured. In simple  terms, dharma means moral law or someone’s religious or  ethical duties towards family, community or country. At a  deeper level, however, dharma extends to living according  to the order of the universe or ṛitam. This includes doing  one’s duty truthfully, following rules of righteous conduct  and leading a life in harmony with the cosmic order.  Dharma is, therefore, duty, law, truth, order and ethics — all  of it together!

Aśhoka details instructions on the conduct of his officials and  mentions ways to ensure that they practised fairness in one of  his edicts. Read the translation below and share your thoughts  on whether those ways would have been successful in helping  manage his empire and how.

“By order of the Beloved of the Gods — the officers and city  magistrates [...] are to be instructed thus:

[…] You are in charge of many thousands of living beings. You  should gain the affection of men. All men are my children,  and just as I desire for my children that they should obtain  welfare and happiness both in this world and the next, the  same do I desire for all men. […] You should strive to practice  impartiality. […] The root of all this is to be even-tempered  and not rash in your work. […] This inscription has been  engraved here in order that the city magistrates should at  all times see to it that men are never imprisoned or tortured  without good reason. […] And for this purpose, I shall send  out on tour every five years, an officer who is not severe or  harsh; who, having investigated this matter..., shall see that  they carry out my instructions.”

The Maurya empire continued for half a century after Aśhoka’s  death. However, his successors were unable to hold the empire  together, and many of the smaller kingdoms broke off and  became independent. Around 185 BCE, India started on another  phase of her journey. Bhavisha and Dhruv will join us on this  journey in the next chapter.

Life in the Mauryan period

Cities like Pāṭaliputra were bustling centres of governance and  commerce. They had palaces, public buildings, and well-planned  streets. With a well-organised taxation system and brisk trade,  the treasury remained strong, fuelling the empire’s growth  and prosperity. Officials of the administration of the empire,  merchants and artisans played key roles in the city life.

The  Sohagaura  copper  plate inscription, dating  back  to  the  4th–3rd  century BCE, is one of  India’s  earliest  known  administrative  records.  Discovered in Sohgaura,  Uttar Pradesh, it is written  in Prakrit using the Brahmi script and is believed to have  been issued during the reign of Chandragupta Maurya. The  inscription mentions the establishment of a granary to store  grain as a precaution against famines, highlighting the state’s  efforts to ensure food security and support its people during  times of crisis.

Megasthenes’ account also throws some light on the society  of that time. A substantial proportion of the population was  engaged in agriculture, which was an important source of  revenue for the empire. Two crops were sown in a year, as rain  fell in both summer and winter. This ensured that famines were

rare and people had ample food. Granaries were well stocked  for any eventualities. Even if war raged nearby, farmers were  protected from it, and agriculture was not disturbed.

Blacksmiths, potters, carpenters, jewellers and other artisans  lived in the cities. The cities were well-planned and had signage  on the streets.  Communication happened through couriers who  carried messages from place to place. The houses were made of  wood and could be up to two storeys tall. The streets had vessels  of water stored at regular intervals in case of fire.

Later accounts describe the cotton dresses people wore — a  lower garment that reached below the knee halfway down to  the ankles and an upper garment that they threw over their  shoulders. Some wore leather shoes with designs and thick soles  to make them look taller.

Wear the hat of a historian. Look carefully at the artefacts  presented on the spread on the next page. What conclusions  can you draw about people and life during the Mauryan era?

Fig. 5.20 has many messages for us,  apart from the beauty and perfection  of the sculpture, and is a fine example  of Mauryan art. This capital (a word  which, here, means ‘top portion’ or  ‘head’) was the top of a pillar that  Aśhoka got erected at Sarnath, near  Varanasi, where the Buddha gave  his first teaching. The four lions  symbolise the royal power; on the  ring below, four powerful animals  (an elephant, a bull, a horse and  one more lion) are depicted, along  with the dharmachakra or wheel  of dharma, which symbolises the  Buddha’s teachings.

the finest examples of Indian architecture. Note that the original structure was made

of bricks and was later enlarged using stone. Aśhoka is said to have constructed

many such stūpas, chaityas, and vihāras for worship, study, and meditation.

The big, round hemispherical structure in the centre of the  stūpa is called the aṇḍa. It represents the universe and is often  built to house sacred relics. People walk around it in a circle  as a form of worship (pradakṣhiṇa).

The Fragile Nature of Empires

You will hear in higher grades about past mighty empires  elsewhere in the world, such as the Roman, the Persian, the  Ottoman, the Spanish, the Russian, the British empires, and so  on. All of them are long gone, but historians keep debating the  causes of their decline.

This image may be familiar to some of you. Indeed, this  capital was chosen as India’s national emblem, to which was  added the Sanskrit motto satyameva jayate or “truth alone  triumphs” (see the national emblem on the left). Besides,  the dharmachakra is depicted at the centre of our national  flag, as you may also have noticed. The motto comes from  the Muṇḍaka Upaniṣhad; in full, it reads satyameva jayate  nānṛitam, that is, “truth alone triumphs, not falsehood”.

One of those causes, as we saw, is the temptation for some of  the empire’s regions to try and become independent. This could  happen if, for example, the emperor needed more resources  for long military campaigns or in times of drought; local rulers  would be burdened with increasing demands for tribute,  leading to resentment. Or if a powerful emperor was followed  by one perceived to be weak, local kings or chieftains might  simply decide to take a chance and stop paying tribute. Also, the  larger an empire, the more difficult it is to hold it together, as  Alexander experienced; far-off territories are often the first to  split away from the empire. Finally, economic crises caused by  natural calamities (such as a long drought or floods) could also  shake an empire’s structure.

Empires are, therefore, something of a paradox. On the one hand,  they can bring about political unity, as the Mauryan empire  did to almost the entire Subcontinent, and reduce or eliminate  warfare among the smaller kingdoms — indeed, a well-managed  empire could lead to greater prosperity than smaller, warring  kingdoms. On the other hand, empires have almost always been  established through war and have maintained their existence

through force and repression. This makes them fragile at their  core and unstable over time.

Before we move on …

Æ An empire is a large territory made up of many smaller  kingdoms or territories. Emperors expanded their kingdoms  mostly to gain fame, amass power, including military power,  and control resources and economic life.

Æ The first empires of India emerged in regions blessed  with abundant natural resources, rivers for irrigation and  transport, and the production of a variety of goods for trade.

Æ Alexander’s campaign in northwest India had a limited  political impact but opened the door for Indo-Greek cultural  contacts.

Æ The Mauryas created a vast empire with a legacy that lasted  centuries. Their legacy includes strengthening trade routes  and economic systems, extensive use of coins for trade,  well-designed urban settlements, and an elaborate system  of administration. They also promoted art and architecture.

Æ Aśhoka was keen to advertise his achievements and project  the image of a benevolent ruler who encouraged his subjects  to follow dharma.
